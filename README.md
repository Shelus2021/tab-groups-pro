# Tab Groups Pro

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

Create persistent file groups for each VS Code workspace and reopen the files you need in a predictable order.

## Features

- Create, rename, reorder, clear, and remove file groups.
- Add the current file or all open text tabs to a group.
- Open or close every file in a group in the saved order.
- Keep group data and expanded state per workspace.
- Preview a file with one click, or pin it with **Open Tab** or a double-click.
- Display file-theme icons, file names, relative folders, full-path tooltips, and the number of files in each group.
- Copy all absolute or workspace-relative paths from a group.
- Follow the active editor in expanded groups.
- Avoid duplicate file and group choices while adding files.

## Getting started

1. Open a folder or workspace in VS Code.
2. Open **Tab Groups Pro** from the Activity Bar.
3. Run **Tab Groups Pro: Add a New Group**, or use **Add All Opened Tabs to Group**.
4. Use a group's inline and context-menu actions to add, reorder, open, close, copy, clear, or remove entries.

Groups are stored in VS Code workspace state and restored when that workspace is opened again.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tab-groups-pro.closeTabsOnOpenGroup` | `false` | Close all currently open editors before opening a group. |
| `tab-groups-pro.closeTabsOnAddAllToGroup` | `false` | Close open text tabs after adding all of them to a group. |

## Notes and limitations

- Files must belong to an open VS Code workspace.
- Only text-file tabs can be added through **Add All Opened Tabs to Group**.
- Group data is workspace-specific and is not synchronized between machines by this extension.
- The current repository snapshot contains the packaged JavaScript runtime, not the original TypeScript source tree. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) before starting long-term development.
