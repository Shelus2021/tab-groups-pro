All notable changes to Tab Groups Pro are documented here.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Added a dedicated Tab Groups Pro Marketplace icon and editable SVG source.
- Added a scoped MIT license for Shelus2021-authored contributions, upstream attribution, and a rights-holder contact notice.
- Remembered expanded and collapsed state for each group.
- Clear-group action that keeps the group itself.
- Commands to copy all absolute or relative file paths from a group.
- Optional closing of open tabs after adding all tabs to a group.
- File-theme icons, relative folder descriptions, full-path tooltips, and group file counts.
- Active-editor tracking in expanded groups.
- Single-click preview and double-click pinning behavior.

### Changed

- Open groups in their saved order and wait for every document operation.
- Show only currently open tabs when adding entries from a group.
- Hide files and groups that would create duplicate entries.
- Keep new groups collapsed by default.
- Remove empty groups without an extra confirmation.
- Use built-in VS Code product icons for actions.
- Default `tab-groups-pro.closeTabsOnOpenGroup` to `false`.
- Improve command names, menus, prompts, and error messages.
- Dispose commands, views, event listeners, emitters, and the output channel cleanly.

### Fixed

- Group renaming now updates child-parent references used by reorder and removal actions.
- Explorer context-menu files can be added without relying on the active editor.
- File names containing spaces are no longer truncated.
- Group expansion state uses the correct VS Code enum and migrates previously saved Boolean state.
- Cancelling new-group creation no longer adds a file to the last existing group.
- Workspace-relative paths now use platform-safe path handling.

### Removed

- Recursive workspace scanning and the legacy `ignorePaths` setting.
- The non-functional nesting-depth setting.
- The unreliable command that synchronized group order from editor tabs.
- Custom colored group icons and bundled action PNGs.
